"There is no royal road to geometry." - Euclid

This module makes triangle processing fun!
The beginner will enjoy how the utils module
lets you get started quickly.

>>> from geometrylib import utils
>>> utils.is_isosceles(5, 5, 7)
True

But fancier programmers can use the Triangle
class to create an actual triangle object
upon which they can then perform lots of operations.
For example, consider this Python program:

from geometrylib.shape import Triangle
t = Triangle(5, 5, 5)
print('Equilateral?', t.is_equilateral())
print('Isosceles?', t.is_isosceles())

Since methods like is_equilateral()
return Boolean values, this program will produce the following output:

Equilateral? True
Isosceles? True

This module only handles three-sided polygons;
five-sided figures are right out.
